## Building

The build requires [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
v3.1.1+ and the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
to be installed in your development environment. In addition you'll need to set
the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the location of your SDK:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/tools/android-sdk
```

## Clone the repository:

	git clone git@github.com:PauloLuan/TerraMobile.git

## Include OSMBonusPack Into Maven Local Repository 

The OSMBonusPack Library doesnâ€™t exist in the Maven center repository. To include manually into local repository, go to the folder 'app/dependencies'

	cd app/dependencies

Then type the following command: 

	mvn install:install-file -Dfile=osmbonuspack_v4.1.jar -DgroupId=org.osmbonuspack -DartifactId=osmbonuspack -Dversion=4.1 -Dpackaging=jar

After satisfying those requirements, the build is pretty simple:

* Run `mvn clean package` from the `app` directory to build the APK only
* Run `mvn clean install` from the root directory to build the app and also run
  the integration tests, this requires a connected Android device or running
  emulator

See [here](https://github.com/PauloLuan/TerraMobile-Client/wiki/Building-From-Eclipse) for
instructions on building from [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org).
